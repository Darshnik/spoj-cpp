 TASK: poker
 LOGIC: 
 1. royal flush - ace, king, queen, jack and ten, all in the same suit
 2. straight flush - five cards of the same suit in sequence, such as 10,9,8,7,6 of clubs; ace can be counted both as the highest card or as the lowest card - A,2,3,4,5 of hearts is a straight flush. But 4,3,2,A,K of hearts is not a straight flush - it's just a flush.
 3. four of a kind - four cards of the same rank, such as four kings.
 4. full house - three cards of one rank plus two cards of another rank
 5. flush - five cards of the same suit (but not a straight flush)
 6. straight - five cards in order - just like the straight flush, but mixed suits
 7. three of a kind - three cards of one rank and two other cards
 8. two pairs - two cards of one rank, two cards of another rank, and one more card
 9. pair - two cards of the same rank
 10. high card - none of the above
